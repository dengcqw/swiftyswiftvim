## Notes on Development with Vim and YCMD

Make sure to put the YouCompleteMe directory in ~/.vim/bundle

I achieved with a symlink to my development directory.

Additionally, my YCMD fork, is symlinked into YouCompleteMe

## Accessing the latest log:

vim  /var/folders/9q/40k26bk91j14s13tgl05dfkh0000gn/T/`ls -tr
/var/folders/9q/40k26bk91j14s13tgl05dfkh0000gn/T/ | grep jedi | tail -1`


# Code and Run

It is possible to edit the python code and just restart the server, without
building!
