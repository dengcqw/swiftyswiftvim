## Notes on Development

Make sure to put the YouCompleteMe directory in ~/.vim/bundle

This is achieved with a symlink usually?

Put the source in YCMD - Symlink too?

## Accessing the latest log:
 vim  /var/folders/9q/40k26bk91j14s13tgl05dfkh0000gn/T/`ls -tr /var/folders/9q/40k26bk91j14s13tgl05dfkh0000gn/T/ | grep jedi | tail -1`


It is possible to edit the python code and just restart the server, without
building!
